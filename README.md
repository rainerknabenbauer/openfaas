Things to think about  
Container reuse, Bootup + loading times in JVM applications (use keep-alive events every 30 seconds or so)

Best practices 
Separate the (invocation) handler separately. It's the only code reloaded on warm/container reuse.  
Self contain dependencies in your function package.

Patterns  
Web Application Pattern  
Serverless Data Lake  
Fan Out Pattern
